# Selecting the appropriate features in battery lifetime predictions - 09 March 2023
Code used to generate analysis and results for the paper.

Features extraction is done in Matlab. The main feature extraction script is featurization.m which calls other scripts in the subfolder Matlab_Utils.
The Machine Learning analysis is entirely done in Python in the different ipynb.

Files needed:
The data from the Severson et al. (Severson, K.A., Attia, P.M., Jin, N. et al. Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation. Nat Energy 4, 383â€“391 (2019)) should be in a folder 'Data'.
